    <div class = "description"> 
        <p>Music has the ability to resonate with us, to bring some understanding and sense to our thoughts and experiences. Through surveys and interviews, I asked 64 people about the most meaningful songs in their life and why they viewed those songs as a piece of themselves. This site, showcasing 148 songs, will take you through their answers and will show you all of the music that has allowed people to love and celebrate, grieve and reflect.
